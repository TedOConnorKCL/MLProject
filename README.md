# MLProject

I have included in this repository the Notebooks used to train each generation of the NN model used in this project, and the reconstruction analysis notebook as well. The training files will not run as I have not included the datasets due to their large size, however you can look at them and see how each model was structured. 

The following files were used to train each generation:

1. Generation 1 - "Original_HK-training.ipynb"
2. Generation 2 - "HK-Separate.ipynb"
3. Generation 3 - "HK-training.ipynb"

The file "recon_check.ipynb" was used for all reconstruction analysis. You will require pytorch, matplotlib, numpy etc so it may be worth creating a virtual environment.
